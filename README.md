# Ask JavaScript Room

This repo is a way to give JavaScript Room community another way to ask questions and stay in touch.

## How it works
This repository makes use of the Github Discussions in order to keep the connection between the author and other community members. In order to participate in discussions, just navigate to the [discussions](https://github.com/room-js/ask/discussions) tab. There you can see the list of existing discussions, perform a search across them and create a new one. Please don't hesitate to shoot your question if you have any. Of course, we're mostly focused on the web development related topics, but we're not limited to them.

## Future ideas
If we see that this idea is really working out and we have more interesting discussions, then I'm planning to generate a static knowledge-sharing website based on the discussions.
